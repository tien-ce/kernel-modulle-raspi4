# Explanation of timer-related structs in `linux/timer.h`

The Linux kernel provides a flexible software timer mechanism implemented in `linux/timer.h`. Timers are used to schedule deferred actions to execute at a future time in kernel space.

## `struct timer_list`

The `struct timer_list` represents a single software timer instance. It can be initialized and registered to execute a callback function after a specified number of jiffies.

### Fields of `struct timer_list`:

- **`struct hlist_node entry`**  
  Links this timer into the kernel's internal hash list of active timers.

- **`unsigned long expires`**  
  The expiration time of the timer, expressed in jiffies. When the current jiffies counter reaches this value, the timer's callback is invoked.

- **`void (*function)(struct timer_list *)`**  
  A pointer to the callback function to be executed when the timer expires. The function receives a pointer to the `struct timer_list` itself.

- **`u32 flags`**  
  Internal flags used to track the state and behavior of the timer.

- **`struct lockdep_map lockdep_map`** *(conditional)*  
  Present only if `CONFIG_LOCKDEP` is enabled. Used for lock dependency tracking and deadlock debugging when the timer interacts with locks.

## Notes

- Timers are designed to run in **softirq context**, so the callback should execute quickly and never sleep.
- They are commonly used for delayed retries, timeout detection, periodic polling, and more.
- When a timer is set, it is inserted into the kernel's timer management system and fires at the specified expiration time.
